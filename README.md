**Work Style and Preferences:**
  When solving a problem, I like to brainstorm and think of ideas and potential problems by speaking them out loud with someone and getting another perspective. That way, more possibilities arise, whether that be potential issues or solutions. When responding to or creating issues and tickets, I prefer to express all my thoughts clearly to ensure mutual understanding of the expected implementation.

**Fun Facts:**
  If you beat me on MonkeyType, I will personally buy you lunch, but you won't beat me :)
